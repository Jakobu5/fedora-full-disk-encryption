# Installing

Fedora was installed quite normaly.
Inside the installer the settings where mostly left to their defaults.
The disk encryption was selected, but this setting only encrypts the root partition of the disk, not boot.

After the installation the disk was splitted into three partitions. *vda1* is the ESP partition.
The second partition was the boot partition that holds the kernel/initramfs files.
